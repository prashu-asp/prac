    <h1>Abstract classes:</h1>
    <h3 >An abstract class is one that is not used to create objects. An abstract class is designed only to act a base class. It is a design concept in program development and provides a base upon which other classes may be built. In the previous example, the student class is an abstract class since it was not used to create any objects.</h3>
