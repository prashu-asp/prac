syntax:


//when u r defining the function outside of the class:


       return_type classname :: operator op(arglist)
       {
        Function body
       }


       ex: vector class_name :: operator+(vector);


// here "operator" is  a key word and 'op' is the symbol that we are trying to overload


//when you are defining the function inside the class:

       return_type operator op(arglist)
       {
        Function body
       }


       ex: vector operator+(vector);
